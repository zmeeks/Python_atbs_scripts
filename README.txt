Most of the scripts here are my solutions to scripting-projects in the book
‘Automate The Boring Stuff with Python’ by Al Sweigart.  Included in each
script is the chapter and page number that the script is given as a project
or given as a script if it was a learning script.  I’ve included a few scripts
here that were just learning scripts.  I typically only solved project scripts that
were new or interesting to me.  

Note: you may need to add your own values in some of the scripts (such as email address
values or API keys.
Note: you may need to download book materials in order for some of the scripts to run 
properly.  The book and its materials may be found online for free at automatetheboringstuff.com/
